function diagonalDifference(arr) {// defines a function named diagonalDifference that takes a 2D array arr as an input.
	let n = arr.length;//n is the number of rows/columns in the matrix
	let primarySum = 0;//sums of the elements
	let secondarySum = 0;//sums of the elements

	for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		primarySum += arr[i][i];//add the current element to primarySum if its row and column indices are equal (i.e., the primary diagonal)
		secondarySum += arr[i][n - i - 1];//add the current element to secondarySum if its row index is equal to n - i - 1 (i.e., the secondary diagonal).
	}

	return Math.abs(primarySum - secondarySum);//calculates the absolute difference between the sums of the primary and secondary diagonals and returns it as the output of the diagonalDifference function.
